# Phase Log

Codex must append a dated section for every implementation phase with acceptance criteria, completed work, test commands/results, migrations and deferred items.

## 2026-10-05 — Phase 0: Repository foundation (started)

Requirements: docs/17–23, 25–28; accepted ADR-0001–0003. Core stays
industry-neutral; domain layers cannot import HTTP/ORM infrastructure.
No business endpoints or authentication bypasses are introduced in this phase.

Acceptance criteria written before feature code:

- P0-01: Locked Python 3.13+ environment; strict lint/types and repeatable tests.
- P0-02: FastAPI `/api/v1` composition root, typed health contracts, sanitized
  problem details, validated request correlation and JSON request logs.
- P0-03: Explicit module ownership and automated layer/boundary checks.
- P0-04: PostgreSQL Alembic baseline upgrades, downgrades and upgrades again;
  no ORM schema creation at runtime; migration drift check passes.
- P0-05: Local PostgreSQL/Redis/private S3-compatible development infrastructure
  documented and health checks distinguish liveness from dependency readiness.
- P0-06: React/TypeScript application shell passes lint, type checks and build;
  communicates its foundation status without pretending business features exist.
- P0-07: CI runs backend tests (including real PostgreSQL), lint, types, migration
  checks, frontend checks and OpenAPI drift validation.
- P0-08: ADRs, startup/rollback instructions, phase backlog and all four progress
  files updated; phase commit created. Phase completion requires CI evidence.

Repository inventory: documentation only; no legacy source or data supplied;
no `.git` directory at startup. Existing MVP review remains reference material.

Initial environment finding: Python 3.14, Node 24, uv and Docker CLI available;
Docker engine unavailable. Real migration validation is a required gate.

### Implementation and evidence
Docker Desktop was started hidden. Dependency pulls initially stalled; ADR-0004
records the pre-schema choice of digest-pinned PostgreSQL 16 and MinIO. All three
project containers subsequently became healthy. No legacy data was touched.

| Criterion | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0-01 | PASS locally | Frozen uv install; Ruff lint/format and strict mypy pass |
| P0-02 | PASS locally | Typed health/errors; UUID correlation; JSON logs; bounded HTTP metrics; OpenTelemetry/W3C context; API negative tests |
| P0-03 | PASS locally | 18 module namespaces; AST checks and forbidden-import regression tests |
| P0-04 | PASS locally | PostgreSQL isolated test: upgrade/downgrade/upgrade, revision checks and Alembic drift check |
| P0-05 | PASS locally | Compose healthy PostgreSQL/Redis/MinIO; private bucket verified; readiness integration test |
| P0-06 | PASS locally | React shell: ESLint 10, strict TypeScript, Vite 8 production build |
| P0-07 | PENDING hosted evidence | Workflow written; equivalent local commands pass; no Git remote configured |
| P0-08 | PASS locally when phase checkpoint is committed | Stack ADR, backlog, runbook, OpenAPI contract, changelog and four progress files |

Final suite: 15 tests pass, including three real-infrastructure integration tests;
no skips or warnings. Commands: `uv run pytest` with `IOP_TEST_DATABASE_URL`,
`uv run ruff check .`, `uv run ruff format --check .`, `uv run mypy`,
`uv run alembic check`, `uv run python scripts/export_openapi.py --check`,
and frontend `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`.
Fail-fast local runner: `scripts/check.ps1`; GitHub workflow: `.github/workflows/quality.yml`.

Migration: `0001_foundation`, empty/reversible baseline; development database at
head. Test database is separate; rollback instructions are in the foundation runbook.

Deferred: hosted CI run (Q-001); authentication/tenant hierarchy/audit features
belong to Phase 1; queue choice to Phase 6; business migrations to owning phases;
production collector/alerts/backup/restore/UAT to Phase 10. Phase 1 has not started.

Phase status: locally verified, awaiting required CI evidence. Checkpoint commit
uses a Phase 0 message and does not claim full phase completion.
